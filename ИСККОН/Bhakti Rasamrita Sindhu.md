The Easten Section
Defining the Different Types of Pure Bhakti

The First Wave Concerning An Overview of Bhakti 
In the Easten Section of Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu

1.1.1 ☀
akhila-rasamrita-murtih prasrimara-ruci-ruddha-taraka-palih
kalita-syama-lalito radha-preyan vidhur jayati

Krishna, the destroyer of all sin and the bestower of all bliss, the very form of the highest bliss, filled with all rasas, excels all others in glory. He brings Taraka and Palika under His control by the diffusion of His beauty; He accepts Syamala and Lalita as His equals; and gives pleasure to Radha by His excellent qualities.

Second meaning:
The full moon, which destroys suffering and creates happiness by its cooling rays, shines everywhere with its excellent qualities and beauty. It is the very form of nectar, filled with all tastes. It eclipses the host of stars by its light, accepts the playful gestures of the night, and fondly enters the Visakha constellation in the spring season.

Vidhu refers to Sri Krishna. Vidhu, Krishna, excels (jayati) in all excellent qualities (vidhur jayati).

Akhila-rasamrita-murtih
The cause of all these outstanding qualities (destroying all suffering, surpassing all, bestowing the greatest bliss and being the source of everything is then described). His unique feature which is the cause of all the qualities is His form of supreme bliss (amrita-murtih) since He contains all twelve rasas (akhila-rasa) starting with santa.

Prasrimara-ruci-ruddha-taraka-palih
One sees the superiority of His appearance in this world through the supreme position of His followers who are endowed with the highest quality of rasas. This reaches its highest degree with those persons endowed with the supreme conjugal rasa.
With the intention of showing the devotees with the highest rasa, and in order to show the successive superiority of rasa in pairs chief gopis, Rupa Gosvami first mentions the chief gopis, and points out the excellence of rasa by their example. Krishna controls (ruddha) Taraka and Pali by His beautiful features (ruci) which radiate outwards (prasrimara).

kalita-syama-lalito
The two chief gopis of medium status are then described.Krishna accepts (kalita) Syamala (syama) and Lalita - making them His very self.

radha-preyan
Then the supreme among the chief gopis is mentioned. Krishna gives most pleasure to Radha (radha-preyan).

Second meaning of the text:
Full moon is the other conventional meaning of the word vidhu. The moon in its aspect of fullness (full moon), when it spreads its beauty everywhere, is comparable to Krishna who is the full manifestation of all qualities of God, spreading His beauty everywhere. Other objects like sun, not having the same qualities, are not suitable objects of comparison. Thus, the meaning of vidhur jayati is “The full moon, destroying suffering and creating happiness, shines everywhere with its excellent qualities and beauty”.
The orb of the moon (murtih) is composed of nectar (amrita) in which there is relish and relish alone (akhila-rasa). Using the same words to describe the moon and Krishna, there is a comparison of another aspect of the moon, its pleasing nature, to the pleasing nature of Krishna. The full moon covers (ruddha) the host of stars (taraka-palih) with its effulgence, which spreads everywhere (prasrimara-ruci). This aspect of the moon,  which eclipses the presence of other beautiful objects by its beautiful rays, is suitable for comparison with the two beloved gopis whom Krishna controls by His beaty, which spreads everywhere. The moon receives (kalita) the amorous charms of the night (syama-lalita). The aspect of the moon embracing the beauty of the night is suitable for comparison with Krishna consorting with Syama and Lalita.
The moon is most affectionate to the constellation called Visakha (radha-preyan). This means that during the spring season the full moon enters Visakha constellation. This aspect of the full moon - having knowing that his glory can be revealed only by approaching the Visakha constellation - is comparable to Krishna knowing that His full glory is revealed only by approaching Radha.

1.1.2
hridi yasya preranaya pravartito 'ham varaka-rupo 'pi |
tasya hareh pada-kamalam vande caitanya devasya ||

I offer my respects to the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord in the form of Caitanya-deva. Though I am a vile person by nature, by His inspiration within my heart, I have undertaken this work.

1.1.3
visrama-mandiratya tasya sanatana-tanor mad-isasya |
bhakti-rasamrita-sindhur bhavatu sadayam pramodaya ||

May this work named "the ocean of nectar composed of bhakti-rasa" always serve as the recreation hall of my Lord manifested in the form called Sanatana (Gosvami) for His pleasure.

1.1.4
bhakti-rasamrita-sindhau caratah paribhuta-kala-jala-bhiyah |
bhakta-makaran asilita-mukti-nandikan namasyami ||

I offer my respects to the devotees who are like makaras, kings among fishes, frolicking in the sweet ocean of devotional rasa; who disregard the insignificant rivers of liberation; and who are free from fear caused by the net of time.

1.1.5
mimamsaka-vadabagneh kathinam api kunthayann asau jihvam |
sphuratu sanatana suciram tava bhakti-rasamritambhodhih ||

O Sanatana, may your ocean of bhakti-rasa remain for a long time, restricting the harsh arguments of the proponents of karma and jnana, just as the restricts the flame of the vadaba fire.

1.1.6
bhakti-rasasya prastutir akhila-jagan-mangala-prasangasya |
ajnenapi mayasya kriyate suhridam pramodaya ||

Though I am ignorant, I have undertaken this work concerning bhakti-rasa related to Krishna, who is auspicious for the whole world, for the joy of my friends.

1.1.7
grantha-vibhagah - 
etasya bhagavad-bhakti-rasamrta-payonidheh
catvarah khalu vaksyante bhagah purvadayah kramat

The divisions of the book:
In this sweet ocean of bhakti-rasa, offered to the Lord, four sections, starting with the eastern section, will be expounded one after the other.

1.1.8
tatra purve vibhage 'smin bhakti-bheda-nirupake
anukramena vaktavyam laharinam catustayam

The Eastern Division defines the different types of bhakti. This will be discussed in four successive waves (chapters).

1.1.9
adya samanya bhakty-adhya dvitiya sadhananvita
bhavasrita trtiya ca turya prema-nirupika

The first wave of the Eastern Division of the ocean is concerned with bhakti in general. The second wave describes sadhana-bhakti. The third wave describes bhava-bhakti. The fourth wave describes prema-bhakti.

1.1.10
tatradau susthu vaisistyam asyah kathayitum sphutam
laksanam kriyate bhakter uttamayah satam matam

In the first wave of chapter, in order to describe clearly the superiority of bhakti to other processes, the unique characteristics of uttama-bhakti will be related, as approved by the acaryas.

1.1.11 ☀
anyabhilasita sunyam
jnana karmady anavritam |
anukulyena krisnanu
silanam bhaktir uttama ||

The highest bhakti is defined as continuous service or emotions directed towards Krishna, His expansions forms or others related to Him, with a pleasing attitude towards Krishna. It should be devoid of desires other than the desire to please the Lord, and unobstructed by impersonal jnana, the materialistic rituals of karma or other unfavorable acts.

Anusilanam - continuous service
The signification of the verbal root sil is twofold:
pravritty-atmaka, expressing action (to worship, practice and serve)
nivritty-atmaka, expressing non-action (to be intensely absorbed).
It has 
casta-rupa, an active form using the body, words or mind.
bhava-rupa, an emotional form consisting of affection and despair of the mind.
However, emotional states of sattva, and even non-sattva, are included in cesta-rupa anisilanam because both are suppressed by action.
Anu is added to silanam (service) to indicate that the service should be continuous.

Krishnanusilanam - service for persons related to Krishna or service for Krishna directly.

Anukulyena - with favorableness or friendliness.
Anukulyena Krishnanusilanam - behavior pleasing for Krishna.

VCT:
Anukulya should be explained as “devoid of hostility on the part of the performer”. This will exclude the demons, because they have hostility, in the form of hatred for Krishna. This definition will also not exclude Yasoda, because she is devoid of hostility to Krishna.

Svarupa-laksana:
Anukulyena Krishnanusilanam, continuous service or emotions directed towards Krishna, His expansions forms or others related to Him, with a pleasing attitude towards Krishna, is the essential characteristic of bhakti.

Tatastha-laksana:
anyabhilasita sunyam - it should be devoid of other desires. Anya (other) indicates that bhakti should have only one desire (to serve the Lord since bhakti is not devoid of desire), and no other desire. Sunya - devoid.
jnana karmady anavritam - it should not be covered by jnana, karma or other items.

Jnana karmady anavritam
Jnana (knowledge) refers to inquiry concerning the impersonal brahman with no qualities. This should be rejected, but inquiry concerning the worshipable form of the Lord should not be rejected, for that knowledge is necessary in bhakti.
Karma refers to daily and periodic duties enjoined in the smritis, and not the actions of serving the Lord, for serving the Lord is the very definition of anusilanam or service.
Adi refers to such practices as renunciation (vairagya), yoga, and sankhya. These, as well as impersonal jnana and smriti actions, are obstructions to pure bhakti.

VCT:
Adi indicates engaging in sacrifices, renunciation, yoga, sankhya and other such items.
Anavritam forbid only those types of jnana and karma, which conceal bhakti.

1.1.12 ☀
yatha sri-narada-pancaratre - 
savopadhi-vinirmuktam tat-paratvena nirmalam |
hrisikena hrisikesa-sevanam bhaktir ucyate ||

Thus, Narada-pancaratra says:
Bhakti is defined as service to the Lord using the senses. It should be done with the intention of pleasing the Lord, free of other desires, and unobstructed by other processes.

tat-paratvena (with devotion to Him, taking Him as the highest object) is the equivalent of anukulyena.
Sarvopadhi-vinirmuktam (devoid of all conditions) is equivalent to anyabhilasita-sunya.
Sevanam is the equivalent of anusilanam.
Nirmalam (without blemish) is the equivalent of jnana-karmady-anavritam.

1.1.13-15
sri-bhagavatasya tritiya-skandhe ca (3.29.12-14) - 
ahaituky avyavahita ya bhaktih purusottame || 13
salokya-sarsti-samipya-sarupyaikatvam apy uta |
diyamanam na grihnanti vina mat-sevanam janah || 14
sa eva bhakti-yogakhya atyantika udahritah || 15

This is also stated in the Third Canto:
These are the characteristics of transcendental loving service to Purusottama, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is without other desires, and it is not contaminated by karma or jnana. In this type of bhakti, My devotees do not accept salokya, sarsti, sarupya, samipya or oneness with Me - even if I offer these liberations - in preference to serving Me. This is called bhakti yoga, and is declared as the highest object of human pursuit. SB 3.29.12-14

1.1.16
salokyetyadi-padyastha-bhaktotkarsa-nirupanam |
bhakter visuddhata-vyaktya laksane paryavasyati ||

The description of the excellence of the devotee in the above verse amounts to describing the characteristics of bhakti by revealing its purity.

1.1.17 ☀
klesaghni subhada moksa-laghuta-krit sudurlabha |
sandrananda-visesatma sri-krisnakarsini ca sa ||

The unique characteristics of bhakti are: its ability to destroy suffering; its bestowal of auspiciousness; its disregard for liberation; its rarity of attainment; its manifestation of concentrated bliss; and its ability to attract Krishna.

1.1.18-19
tatrasyah klesaghnatvam - 
klesas tu papam tad-bijam avidya ceti te tridha || 18

The first topic, it ability to destroy all suffering, will be discussed: 
Suffering is three-fold: sinful reaction, the seed of sin and ignorance.

tatra papam - 
aprarabdham bhavet papam prarabdham ceti tad dvidha || 19

First sinful reactions will be discussed:
There are two types of sinful reactions (effects of sinful acts): effects which are to be experienced in future lives (aprarandham) and effects which are to be experienced in this lifetime (prarabdham).

1.1.20
tatra aprarabdha-haratvam, yatha ekadase (11.14.19) - 
yathagnih susamiddharcih karoty edhamsi bhasmasat |
tatha mad-visaya-bhaktir uddhavainamsi kritsnasah ||

Here is an example of destroying all aprarabdha reactions, from the Eleventh Canto of Bhagavatam:
My dear Uddhava, devotional service in relationship with Me is like a blazing fire that can burn to ashes all the fuel of sinful activities supplied to it. SB 11.14.19

1.1.21
prarabdha-haratvam, yatha tritiye (3.33.6) - 
yan-nama-dheya-sravananukirtanad
yat-prahvanad yat-smaranad api kvacit |
svado 'pi sadyah savanaya kalpate
kutah punas te bhagavan nu darsanat ||

Here is proof of destroying prarabdha reactions, from the Third Canto of Bhagavatam:
To say nothing of the spiritual advancement of persons who see the Supreme Person face to face, even a person born in a family of  dog-eaters immediately becomes eligible to perform Vedic sacrifices if he once utters the holy name of the Supreme Personality of Godhead or chant about Him, hears about His pastimes, offers Him obeisances or even remembers Him. SB 3.33.6

1.1.22
durjatir eva savanayogyatve karanam matam |
durjaty-arambhakam papam yat syat prarabdham eva tat ||

It was understood that the low birth of the dog-eater is the cause of his disqualification for performing sacrifices. The sinful reaction by which he attains such low birth in this life is called the prarabdha sin.

1.1.23 ☀
padma-purane ca -
aprarabdha-phalam papam kutam bijam phalonmukham |
kramenaiva praliyeta visnu-bhakti-ratatmanam ||

Also, in the Padma Purana it is said:
For those engaged in bhakti to Visnu, step by step the aprarabdha, kuta, bija and prarabdha-karmas are destroyed.

Phalonmukham means prarabdha-karma the sinful reaction presently being experienced in this life as happiness or suffering.
Bija means that reaction which is about to become prarabdha, about to be experienced, and is in the form of impressions.
Kuta refers to sinful reactions which are about to become bija.
Aprarabdha-phalam means those reactions which are not prarabdha (they are not to be experienced in this life at all), but which cause effects in the form of kuta, bija and prarabdha.

1.1.24
bija-haratvam, yatha sasthe (6.2.17) - 
tais tany aghani puyante tapo-dana-vratadibhih |
nadharmajam tad-hridayam tad apisanghri-sevaya || 24

An illustration of bhakti destroying the seed of sin, namely, material desires, is found in the Sixth Canto:
Although one may neutralize the reactions of sinful life through austerity, charity, vows and other such methods, these pious activities cannot uproot the material desires in one’s heart. However, if one serves the lotus feet of the Personality of Godhead, he is immediately freed from all such contaminations. SB 6.2.17

1.1.25
avidya-haratvam, yatha caturthe - 
yat-pada-pankaja-palasa-vilasa-bhaktya
karmasayam grathitam udgrathayanti santah |
tadvan na rikta-matayo yatayo 'pi ruddha-
sroto-ganas tam aranam bhaja vasudevam || 25

Next bhakti’s ability to destroy avidya is illustrated:
The devotees, by actions of service to the toes of the lotus feet of the Lord, can very easily overcome the knot of ignorance carrying unlimited impressions of karma, tied tightly by action. Because this is very difficult, the empty-minded non-devotees - the jnanis and yogis - although trying to stop the flow of sense activities, cannot do so. Therefore you are advised to engage in the devotional service of Krishna, the son of Vasudeva. SB 4.22.39

1.1.26
padme ca - 
kritanuyatra-vidyabhir hari-bhaktir anuttama |
avidyam nidahaty asu dava-jvaleva pannagim ||26

Padma Purana says the following:
As the forest fire burns up a female snake demon, supreme devotion to the Lord quickly burns up avidya completely by the knowledge (vidya) which accompanies bhakti.

1.1.27 ☀
subhadatvam -
subhani prinanam sarva-jagatam anuraktata |
sad-gunah sukham ity-adiny akhyatani manisibhih ||27

Next, the second unique characteristic of uttama-bhakti, namely, its bestowal of subha, is discussed:
The wise explain that there are four types of auspiciousness (subha): affection for all living entities, being attractive to all living entities, possession of good qualities, and happiness, as well as other items.

1.1.28
tatra jagat-prinanadi-dvaya-pradatvam, yatha padme -
yenarcito haris tena tarpitani jaganty api |
rajyanti jantavas tatra jangamah sthavara api ||28

The first two types of subha are illustrated in the Padma Purana:
He who worships the Lord is pleasing to all living entities; and all the inhabitants of the world, both moving and non-moving, are pleasing to him.

1.1.29
sad-gunadi-pradatvam - 
yasyasti bhaktir bhagavaty akincana
sarvair gunais tatra samasate surah |
harav abhaktasya kuto mahad guna
mano rathenasati dhavato bahih ||29

Bhakti bestows good qualities and other things (sad-gunadi):
One who has unflinching devotion for the Personality of Godhead has the Lord and his followers along with all their good qualities under his control. But one who is not a devotee of the Lord has only material qualifications that are of little value. He simply pursues temporary material objects motivated by desire. SB 5.18.12

1.1.30
sukhapradatvam -
sukham vaisayikam brahmam aisvaram ceti tat tridha || 30

Bhakti bestows happiness:
There are three types of happiness: from material things, from brahman realization and from the Lord.

1.1.31
yatha tantre -
siddhayah paramascarya bhukti muktis ca sasvati |
nityam ca paramanando bhaved govinda-bhaktitah || 31

Thus is said in a tantra:
Astounding mystic powers, material enjoyment, eternal happiness in the realization of brahman, and eternal bliss from service to the Lord all appear from bhakti to Govinda.

1.1.32
yatha hari-bhakti-sudhodaye ca -
bhuyo 'pi yace devesa tvayi bhaktir dridhastu me |
ya moksanta-caturvarga phalada sukhada lata ||32

Thus it also says in Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya:
O Lord of the devas! I again pray to You that I may have firm devotion to You. That bhakti is a creeper which bestows artha, dharma, kama and also the happiness of realization of the Lord.

1.1.33
moksa laghutakrit -
manag eva prarudhayam hridaye bhagavad-ratau |
purusarthas tu catvaras trinayante samantatah || 33

Bhakti causes total disregard for libration:
When even a little attraction for the Lord grows in the heart, the four objects of human attainment - artha, dharma, kama and moksa - becomes like grass, shameful to appear before bhakti.

1.1.34
yatha sri-narada pancaratre -
hari-bhakti-maha-devyah sarva mukty-adi-siddhayah |
bhuktyas cadbhutas tasya cetikavad anuvratah || 34

Thus, Narada-pancaratra says:
All the siddhis headed by liberation and all astonishing material pleasures follow after the great goddess called Hari-bhakti like fearful maidservants.

1.1.35
sudurlabha -
sadhanaughair anasangair alabhya sucirad api |
harina casvadeyeti dvidha sa syat sudurlabha || 35

Bhakti is rarely attained:
Bhakti is difficult to attain in two ways: if undertaken in great quantity but without attachment, bhakti cannot be attained even after a long time; and even if practiced with attachment, Krishna does not give bhakti to the practitioner immediately.

1.1.36
tatra adya, yatha tantre -
jnanatah sulabha muktir bhuktir yajnadi-punyatah |
seyam sadhana-sahasrair hari-bhaktih sudurlabha || 36

The first type of rarity (by practice without attachment) is illustrated in one of the tantras:
Liberation is easily attained by jnana and material enjoyment is easily attained by punyas such as sacrifice, after attaining dedication to those goals by thousand of attempts. However, bhava-bhakti to the Lord cannot be attained if one practice thousands of different sadhanas (because asakti will not appear).

1.1.37
dvitiya, yatha pancama-skandhe (5.6.18) -
rajan patir gurur alam bhavatam yadunam
daivam priyah kula-patih kva ca kinkaro vah |
astv evam anga bhajatam bhagavan mukundo
muktim dadati karhicit sma na bhakti-yogam || 37

The second type of rarity is described in the Bhagavatam.
My dear King, the Supreme Person, Mukunda, is actually the maintainer of all the members of the Pandava and Yadu dynasties. He is your spiritual master, worshipable Deity, friend, and the director of your activities. To say nothing of this, He sometimes serves your family as a messenger or servant. This means that He worked just as ordinary servants do. Those engaged in getting the Lord’s favor attain liberation from the Lord very easily, but He does not give bhava-bhakti at all times. SB 5.6.18

1.1.38
sandrananda-visesatma -
brahmanando bhaved esa cet prararddha-gunikritah |
naiti bhakti-sukhambhodheh paramanu-tulam api || 38

Bhakti is composed of a special condensed bliss:
The bliss of brahman realization accumulated by samadhi lasting for half of Brahmana’s life cannot compare to one drop of the ocean of the happiness of bhakti.

1.1.39
yatha, hari-bhakti-sudhodaye - 
tvat-saksat-karanahlada-visuddhabdhi-sthitasya me |
sukhani gospadayante brahmany api jagad-guro || 39

Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya says:
O guru of the universe, on seeing You directly, I am situated in a pure ocean of bliss. All the happiness of impersonal brahman is as insignificant as the water in the hoof print of a cow.

1.1.40
tatha bhavartha-dipikayam ca -
tvat-kathamrita pathodhau viharanto maha-mudah |
kurvanti kritinah kecit catur-vargam trinopamam || 40

Also, it is said in Bhavartha-dipika (10.88.11):
Some fortunate people play in the sweet ocean of Your topics and enjoy the greatest bliss. They consider the happiness from artha, dharma, kama and moksa to be as insignificant as grass.

1.1.41
sri-krisnakarsini -
kritva harim prema-bhajam priya-varga-samanvitam |
bhaktir vasikarotiti sri-krisnakarsini mata || 41

Bhakti attracts Krishna and His associates:
Bhakti is called sri-krisnakarsini because it makes the Lord addicted to prema and brings Him under control along with His assiciates.

1.1.42
yatha ekadase (11.14.20) -
na sadhyati mam yogo na sankhyam dharma uddhava |
na svadhyayas tapas tyago yatha bhaktir mamorjita || 42

Thus Bhagavatam says in the Eleventh Canto:
My dear Uddhava, the unalloyed devotional service in the form of prema-bhakti rendered to Me by My devotees brings Me under their control. Those engaged in mystic yoga, Sankhya philosophy, pious work, Vedic study, austerity or renunciation cannot thus control Me to this extent. SB 11.14.20

1.1.43
saptame (7.10.48) ca naradoktau -
yuyam nri-loke bata bhuri-bhaga
lokam punana munayo 'bhiyanti |
yesam grhan avasatiti saksad
gudham param brahma manusya-lingam || 43

Similarly Narada says in the Seventh Canto of Bhagavatam:
My dear Maharaja Yudhisthira, all of you [the Pandavas] are extremely fortunate, for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Krishna, lives in your palace just like a human being. Great saintly persons know this very well, and therefore they constantly visit this house. SB 7.10.48

1.1.44
agrato vaksyamanayas tridha bhakter anukramat |
dvisah sadbhih padair etan mahatyam parikirtitam || 44

Three types of bhakti will be explained, later, one after the other. The greatness of bhakti is uniquely glorified by the six qualities just mentioned, two qualities appearing in each type of bhakti.

1.1.45
klm ca -
svalpapi rucir eva syad bhakti-tattvavabodhika |
yuktis tu kevala naiva yad asya apratisthata || 45

Furthermore, it should be started:
Even if one has a little taste for the topic of bhakti, he can understand it. He who tries to understand bhakti by dry logic cannot understand it, because logic is insubstantial.

1.1.46
tatra pracinair apy uktam -
yatenapadito 'py arthah kusalair anumatribhih |
abhiyuktatarair anyair anyathaivopapadyate || 46

Concerning this topic it is said by the ancient authorities:
A person more skillful at logic can bring about a conclusion different from what was carefully proven previously by another skillful logical.

The Second Wave Concerning Sadhana-bhakti 
In the Easten Section of Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu

1.2.1
sa bhaktih sadhanam bhavah prema ceti tridhodita  || 1

There are three types of bhakti: sadhana, bhava and prema.

Sadhya-rupa or harda-rupa-bhakti has five types: bhava, prema, pranaya, sneha and raga. In Ujjvala-nila-mani, three more types are mentioned: mana, anuraga and maha-bhava.

1.2.2
tatra sadhana bhaktih -
kriti-sadhya bhavet sadhya-bhava sa sadhanabhidha |
nitya-siddhasya bhavasya prakatyam hridi sadhyata || 2

Now sadhana-bhakti will be defined:
Action of the senses, which produces the stage of bhava, is called sadhana-bhakti. This attained state of bhava-bhakti (sadhyata) is an eternal sthayi-bhava which is not created, but simply manifests within the soul by the spiritual energy of the Lord.

1.2.3
sa bhaktih saptama-skandhe bhangya devarsinodita || 3

Narada speaks of sadhana-bhakti along with items that seem to be bhakti in the Seventh Canto.

1.2.4
yatha saptame-
tasmat kenapy upayena manah krisne nivesayet || 4

There it is also said:
Therefore, one may somehow think of Krishna, by any of the favorable methods. SB 7.1.32

1.2.5
vaidhi raganuga ceti sa dvidha sadhanabhidha || 5

There are two types of sadhana-bhakti: vaidhi and raganuga.

1.2.6 ☀
tatra vaidhi -
yatra raganavaptatvat pravrittir upajayate |
sasanenaiva sastrasya sa vaidhi bhaktir ucyate  || 6

Now, here is the definition of vaidhi-bhakti:
Where the actions of bhakti arise, not from the attainment of raga, but by the teachings of scriptures, it is called vaidhi-bhakti.

1.2.7
yatha, dvitiye (2.1.5) -
tasmad bharata sarvatma bhagavan isvaro harih  |
srotavyah kirtitavyas ca smartavyas cechatabhayam || 7

This is illustrated in the Second Canto:
O descendant of King Bharata, one who desires to be free from all miseries must hear about, glorify and also remember the Personality of Godhead, who is the Supersoul, the controller and the savior from all miseries. SB 2.1.5

1.2.8 ☀
padme ca -
smartavyah satatam visnur vismartavyo na jatucit  |
sarva-vidhi-nisedhah syur etayor eva kinkarah || 8

In the Padma Purana it is said:
One should always remember Visnu and never forget Him. All injunctions and prohibitions are dependent on these two principles.

1.2.9
ity asau syad vidhir nityah sarva-varnasramadisu |
nityatve 'py asya nirnitam ekadasy-adivat-phalam  || 9

Thus, everyone within and outside the varnasrama system should always follow this rule concerning worship of the Lord. Though it is always to be followed as a daily duty according to the scriptures, the scriptures also ascribe attractive material results for observing it, as in the case of the Ekadasi vrata.

1.2.10-11
yatha, ekadase (11.5.2-3) tu vyaktam evoktam -
mukha bahuru-padebhyah purusasyasramaih saha |

ya esam purusam saksad atma-prabhavam isvaram |
na bhajanty avajananti sthanad bhrastah patanty adhah || 11

In the Eleventh Canto is expressed clearly that vaidhi-bhakti should be followed by all varnas and asramas:
Each of the four social orders, headed by the brahmanas, was born through different combinations of the modes of nature, from the face, arms thighs and feet of the Supreme Lord in His universal form. Thus, the four spiritual orders were also generated. If any of the members of the four varnas and four asramas fail to worship or intentionally disrespect the Personality of Godhead, who is the source of their own creation, they will fall down from their position into a hellish state of life. SB 11.5.2-3

1.2.12
tat phalam ca, tatraiva -
evam kriya-yoga-pathaih puman vaidika-tantrikaih |
arcann ubhyatah siddhim matto vindaty abhipsitam || 12

The results of vaidhi-bhakti are stated:
By worshiping Me through the various methods prescribed in the Vedas and tantras, one will gain from Me his desired perfection both in this life and the next. SB 11.27.49

1.2.13 ☀
pancaratre ca -
surarse vihita sastre harim uddisya ya kriya  |
saiva bhaktir iti prokta taya bhaktih para bhavet  || 13

In the pancaratra it says:
O Devarsi, all activities prescribed in the scriptures with the Lord as the object are called vaidhi-bhakti. By this performance of bhakti, one attains prema-bhakti.

1.2.14
tatra adhikari -
yah kenapy atibhagyena jata-sraddho 'sya sevane |
natisakto na vairagya-bhag asyam adhikary asau  || 14

The qualified person is described as follows:
The person who has developed faith in serving the Lord by impressions arising from previous association with devotees, who is not too attached to material objects, and who is not too detached, is qualified for vaidhi-bhakti.

1.2.15 ☀ 
yathaikadase -
yadricchaya mat-kathadau jata-sraddho 'stu yah puman |
na nirvinno natisakto bhakti-yogo 'sya siddhidah || 15

In the Eleventh Canto it is said:
If somehow of other by good fortune one develops faith in hearing and chanting My glories, such a person, being neither very disgusted with nor attached to material life, should achieve perfection through the path of loving devotion to Me. SB 11.20.8

1.2.16
uttamo madhyamas ca syat kanisthas ceti sa tridha  || 16

There are three types of persons qualified for vaidhi-sadhana-bhakti: the uttama, the madhyama and the kanistha.

1.2.17
tatra uttamah - 
sastre yuktau ca nipunah sarvatha dridha-niscayah |
praudha-sraddho 'dhikari yah sa bhaktav uttamo matah || 17

The uttamadhikari is defined as follows:
The person who is skilful in scripture and logic, completely firm in his belief, with deep faith, is considered qualified as uttama in vaidhi-bhakti.

1.2.18
tatra madhyamah -
yah sastradisv anipunah sraddhavan sa tu madhyamah || 18

The madhyamadhikari is defined as follows:
The person who is not fully conversant with scriptures like the uttamadhikari but has firm conviction in them is known as the madhyamadhikari.

1.2.19
tatra kanisthah -
yo bhavet komala-sraddhah sa kanistho nigadyate || 19

The definition of the kanisthadhikari is as follows:
He who has weak faith because of even less knowledge of scriptures than the madhyamadhikary is called the kanistha.

1.2.20-21
tatra gitadisuktanam caturnam adhikarinam  |
madhye yasmin bhagavatah kripa syat tat-priyasya va || 20

sa ksina-tat-tad-bhavah syac chuddha-bhakty-adhikaravan
yathebhah saunakadis ca dhruvah sa ca catuhsanah || 21

Among the four types of persons qualified for bhakti mentioned in Gita, when they receive the mercy of the Lord of His devotee and eradicate those tendencies, they becomes qualified for pure bhakti. Examples of this are Gajendra, Saunaka and the sages, Dhruva and also the four Kumaras.

1.2.22
bhukti-mukti-spriha yavat pisaci hridi vartate |
tavad bhakti-sukhasyatra katham abhyudayo bhavet || 22

How can the happiness of bhakti arise in the heart when the witch of desire for enjoyment and liberation remains there?

1.2.23
tatrapi ca visesena gatim anvim anicchatah |
bhaktir hrita-manah-pranan premna tan kurute janan || 23

By prema, the bhakti processes such as hearing take possession of the mind and senses of persons who do not desire the goal of liberation at all.

1.2.24
tatha ca, tritiye -
tair darsaniyavayavair udara-
vilasa-haseksita-vama-suktaih |
hritatmano hrita-pranams ca bhaktir

In the Third Canto it is said:
Bhakti steals away the mind and senses of the persons who do not desire liberation, by the prema arising from realizing to attractive limbs, pastimes, charming words, glances and playful smiles of the generous Lord. SB 3.25.36

1.2.25
sri krisna-caranambhoja-seva-nirvrita-cetasam |
esam moksaya bhaktanam na kadacit spriha bhavet || 25

Devotees who are absorbed in the bliss of service to the lotus feet of Krisna should never desire liberation.

1.2.26
yatha tatraiva, srimad-uddhavoktau (3.4.15) -
ko nv isa te pada-saroja-bhajam
sudurlabho 'rthesu catursv apiha |
tathapi naham pravrinomi bhuman
bhavat-padambhoja-nisevanotsukah || 26

Uddhava also states this:
O my Lord, devotees who are engaged in the transcendental loving service of Your lotus feet have no difficulty in achieving anything within the realm of the four principles of religiosity, economic development, sense gratification and liberation. Nevertheless, O great one, as far as I am concerned, I have preferred only to engage in the loving service of Your lotus feet. SB 3.4.15

1.2.27
tatraiva, sri-kapila-devoktau - 
naikatmatam me sprihayanti kecin
mat-pada-sevabhirata mad-ihah |
ye 'nyonyato bhagavatah prasajya

And Kapila states the same:
A pure devotee, who is attached to the activities of devotional service and who always engages in the service of My lotus feet, never desires to become one with Me. Such a devotee, who is unflinchingly engaged, always glorifies My pastimes and activities. SB 3.25.34

1.2.28
tatraiva (3.29.13) -
salokya-sarsti-samipya-sarupyaikatvam apy uta |
diyamanam na grihnanti vina mat-sevanam janah || 28

Kapila also says:
A pure devotee does not accept any kind of liberation - salokya, sarsti, samipya, sarupya or ekatva - even though they are offered by the Supreme Personality of Godhead SB - if they are not accompanied by service. SB 3.29.13

1.2.29
caturthe sri-dhruvoktau (4.9.10) -
ya nirvritis tanu-bhritam tava pada-padma-
dhyanad bhavaj-jana-katha-sravanena va syat |
sa brahmani sva-mahimany api natha ma bhut
kim tv antakasi-lulitat patatam vimanat || 29

In the Fourth Canto, Dhruva says:
My Lord, the transcendental bliss derived from meditation upon Your lotus feet or hearing about Your glories from pure devotees is so unlimited that it is far beyond the stage of brahmananda, wherein one thinks himself merged in the impersonal brahman as one with the Supreme. Since brahmananda is also defeated by the transcendental bliss derived from devotional service, then what to speak of the temporary blissfulness of elevating oneself to the heavenly planets, which is ended by the separating sword of time? Although one may be elevated to the heavenly planets, he falls down in due course of time. SB 4.9.10

Chapter 4 -

1.2.30
tatraiva srimad-adirajoktau (4.20.24) -
na kamaye natha tad apy aham kvacin

mahattamantar-hridayan mukha-cyuto
vidhatsva karnayutam esa me varah || 30

Concerning this Prithu also speaks:
My dear Lord, I therefore do not wish to have the benediction of merging into Your existence, a benediction in which there is no existence of the nectarean beverage of Your lotus feet. I want the benediction of at least one million ears, for thus I may be able to hear about the glories of Your lotus feet from the mouths of Your pure devotees. SB 4.20.24

1.2.31

In the Fifth Canto Suka says:
The king gave up everything that was difficult for others to give up. He gave up his kingdom, his wife and his family. His opulence was so great that even the demigods envied it, yet he gave up that wealth endowed with attractive glances. It was quite befitting for great devotees whose minds are attracted to the service of the enemy of the Madhu demon. Indeed, even liberation is considered insignificant for those whose minds are attracted to the loving service of the Lord. SB 5.14.44

1.2.32
sasthe sri-vritroktau - 
na naka-pristham na ca paramesthyam
na sarva-bhaumam na rasadhipatyam |

In the Sixth Canto Vritra says:
O my Lord, source of all opportunities, I do not desire to enjoy in Dhruvaloka, the heavenly planets or the planet where Lord Brahma resides, nor do I want to be the supreme ruler of all the earthly planets or the lower planetary systems. I do not desire the perfection of astanga-yoga, nor do I want liberation if I have to give up Your lotus feet. SB 6.11.25

1.2.33
tatraiva sri-rudroktau -
narayana-parah sarve na kutascana bibhyati |
svargapavarga-narakesv api tulyartha-darsinah || 33

Lord Siva also speaks on this subject:
Devotees solely engaged in the devotional service of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Narayana, never fear any condition of life. For them the heavenly planets, liberation and the hellish planets are all the same, for such devotees are interested only in the service of the Lord. SB 6.17.28

1.2.34
tatraiva indoktau -
aradhanam bhagavata ihamana nirasisah |
ye tu necchanty api param te svartha-kusalah smritah || 34

Concerning this, Indra has also spoken:
Those who are interested only in worshipping the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who do not desire anything material from the Lord and do not even want liberation, are expert at understanding what is most beneficial for themselves. SB 6.18.74

1.2.35
saptame prahladoktau -

kim tair guna-vyatikarad iha ye sva-siddhah |
dharmadayah kim agunena ca kanksitena
saram jusam caranayor upagayatam nah || 35

In the Seventh Canto, Prahlada speaks:
Nothing is unobtainable for devotees who have satisfied the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is the cause of all causes, the original source of everything. The Lord is the reservoir of unlimited spiritual qualities. For devotees, therefore, who are transcendental to the modes of material nature, what is the use of following the principles of religion, economic development, sense gratification and liberation, which are all automatically obtainable under the influence of the modes of nature? We devotees always glorify the lotus feet of the Lord, and therefore we need not ask for anything in terms of dharma, kama, artha and moksa. SB 7.6.25

1.2.36
tatraiva sakroktau -
pratyanitah parama bhavata trayata nah sva-bhaga

There also Indra speaks:
O Supreme Lord, You are our deliverer and protector. Our shares of sacrifices, which are actually Yours, have been recovered from the demon by You. Because the demoniac king Hiranyakasipu was most fearsome, our hearts, which are Your permanent abode, were all overtaken by him. Now, by Your presence, the gloom and darkness in our hearts have been dissipated. O Lord, for those who always engage in Your service, which is more exalted than liberation, all material opulence is insignificant. They do not even care for liberation, not to speak of the benefits of kama, artha and dharma. SB 7.8.42

1.2.37
astame sri-gajenroktau -
ekantino yasya na kancanartham

In the Eighth Canto, Gajendra speaks:
Unalloyed devotees, who have no desire other than to serve the Lord, worship Him in full surrender and always hear and chant about His activities, which are most wonderful and auspicious. Thus, they always merge in an ocean of transcendental bliss. SB 8.3.20

1.2.38
navame sri-vaikunthanathoktau -
mat-sevaya pratitam te salokyadi-catustayam |
necchanti sevaya purnah kuto 'nyat kala-viplutam || 38

In the Ninth Canto, the Lord of Vaikuntha speaks:
My devotees, who are always satisfied to be engaged in My loving service, are not interested even in the four principles of liberation, salokya, sarupya, samipya and sarsti, although these are automatically achieved by their service. What then is to be said of such perishable happiness as elevation to the higher planetary systems? SB 9.4.67

1.2.39
sri-dasame nagapatni-stutau -
na naka-pristham na ca sarva-bhaumam
na paramesthyam na rasadhipatyam |
na yoga-siddhir apunar-bhavam va

In the Tenth Canto the wives of Kaliya speaks:
Those who have attained the dust of Your lotus feet never hanker for the kingship of Dhruva-loka, limitless sovereignty, the position of Brahma or rulership over the earth. They are not interested even in the perfections of yoga or in liberation itself. SB 10.16.37

1.2.40
tatraiva sri-veda-stutau -

The personified Vedas pray as follows:
My Lord, some fortunate souls have gotten relief from the fatigue of material life by diving into the vast nectar ocean of Your pastime, which You enact when You manifest Your personal forms to propagate the unfathomable science of the self. These rare souls, indifferent even to liberation, renounce the happiness of home and family because of their association with devotees who are like flocks of swans enjoying at the lotus of Your feet. SB 10.87.21

1.2.41
ekadase sri-bhagavad-uktau -
na kincit sadhavo dhira bhakta hy ekantino mama |
vanchanty api maya dattam kaivalyam apunar-bhavam || 41

In the Eleventh Canto the Lord speaks:
Because My devotees possess saintly behavior and deep intelligence, they completely dedicated themselves to Me and do not desire anything besides Me. Indeed, even if I offer them liberation from birth and death, they do not accept it. SB 11.20.34

1.2.42
tatha -
na paramesthyam na mahendra-dhisnyam
na sarvabhaumam na rasadhipatyam |
na yoga-siddhir apunar-bhavam va
mayy arpitatmecchati mad vinanyat || 42

Also in the Eleventh Canto it is said:
The devotee who has offered his soul to Me does not want anything if it is separate from Me - not the position of the supreme demigod of the universe, Brahma, nor that of Lord Indra, nor kingship over the entire earth or over the lower planetary systems, nor the mystic perfections of yoga, nor even freedom from the cycle of rebirth. SB 11.14.14

1.2.43
dvadase sri-rudroktau -
naivecchaty asisah kvapi brahmarsir moksam apy uta |
bhaktim param bhagavati labdhavan puruse 'vyaye || 43

In the Twelfth Canto Siva speaks:
Surely, this saintly brahmana does not desire any benediction, not even liberation itself, for he has attained pure devotional service unto the inexhaustible Personality of Godhead. SB 12.10.6

1.2.44
padma-purane ca karttika-mahatmye (damodarastake) -
varam deva moksam na moksavadhim va
na canyam vrine 'ham varesad apiha |
idam te vapur natha gopala-balam
sada me manay avirastam kim anyaih || 44

In the Padma Purana, Kartika-mahatmya it is said:
O Lord, I do not accept liberation or anything leading up to liberation from the Lord who awards benedictions. May Your form as the young cowherd boy remain in my mind and nothing else.

1.2.45
kuveratmajau baddha-murtyaiva yadvat
tvaya mocitau bhakti-baddhau kritau ca |
tatha prema-bhaktim svakam me prayaccha
na mokse graho me 'sti damodareha || 45

Bound up by mother Yasoda with the ropes of devotion, You freed the sons of Kuvera, and bound them with bhakti. In the same way, please bestow on me prema-bhakti. O Damodara, I do not accept liberation.

1.2.46-47
hayasirsiya-sri-narayana-vyuha-stave ca -
na dharma kamam artham va moksam va varadesvara |

tatraiva -
punah punar varan ditsur visnur muktim na yacitah |
bhaktir eva vrita yena prahladam tam namamy aham || 47

The Narayana-vyuha-stava in the Hayasirsa-pancaratra says:
O Lord! Bestower of benedictions! I do not pray for dharma, kama, artha or moksa. I desire only service at Your lotus feet.

I offer my respects to Prahlada, who asked only for devotion. He did not pray to Visnu for liberation though Visnu wanted to give many benedictions.

1.2.48
yadricchaya labdham api visnor dasarathes tu yah |
naicchan moksam vina dasyam tasmai hanumate namah  || 48

I offer my respects to Hanuman, who did not want liberation, which Rama could easily give, but instead wanted servitude.

1.2.49
ataeva prasiddham sri-hanumad-vakyam -
bhava-bandha-cchide tasyai sprihayami na muktaye |
bhavan prabhur aham dasa iti yatra vilupyate || 49

Hanuman’s statement is also famous:
I do not desire liberation that cuts the boundage of material life, because in that state of liberation, awareness that You are the master and I am the servant disappears.

1.2.50-51
sri-narada pancaratre ca jitante stotre -
dharmartha-kama-moksesu neccha mama kadacana |
tvat-pada-pankajasyadho jivitam diyatam mama || 50

moksa-salokya-sarupyan prarthaye na dharadhara |
icchami hi mahabhaga karunyam tava suvrata || 51

In the Jitanta-stotra of the Narada-pancaratra it is said:
I do not have the desire at all for dharma, artha, kama or moksa. Please make my life completely dependent upon Your lotus feet. I do not pray for liberation, salokya or sarupya, O upholder of the earth. Most distinguished Lord, true to Your vows, I desire only Your mercy.

1.2.52
ataeva sri-bhagavate sasthe -
muktanam api siddhanam narayana-parayanah |
sudurlabhah prasantatma kotisv api maha-mune || 52

In the Sixth Canto, it says:
O great sage! Among many millions who are liberated and perfect in knowledge of liberation, one may be a devotee of Lord Narayana, or Krisna. Such a devotee, who is fully peaceful, is extremely rare. SB 6.14.5

1.2.53
prathame ca sri-dharmaraja-matuh stutau (1.8.20) -
tatha paramahamsanam muninam amalatmanam |
bhakti-yoga-vidhanartham katham pasyema hi striyah || 53

In the First Canto, Kunti prays:
You Yourself descend to propagate the transcendental science of devotional service unto the hearts of the advanced transcendentalists and mental speculators, who are purified by being able to discriminate between matter and spirit. How, then, can we women know You perfectly? SB 1.8.20

1.2.54
tatraiva sri-sutoktau (1.7.10) -
atmaramas ca munayo nirgrantha apy urukrame |
kurvanty ahaitukim bhaktim ittham-bhuta-guno harih || 54

On this subject Suta also speaks:
All different varieties of atmaramas (those who take pleasure in atma, or spirit self), especially those established on the path of self-realization, and those freed from all the rules and prohibition of the scriptures, desire to render unalloyed devotional service unto the Personality of Godhead. This means that the Lord possesses transcendental qualities and therefore can attract everyone, including liberated souls. SB 1.7.10

1.2.55
atra tyajyatayaivokta muktih panca-vidhapi cet |
salokyadis tathapy atra bhaktya nativirudhyate || 55

Though the five types of mukti have been described as worthy of rejection, salokya, sarsti, samipya and sarupya are not so contradictory to bhakti.

1.2.56
sukhaisvaryottara seyam prema-sevottarety api |
salokyadir dvidha tatra nadya seva-jusam mata || 56

There are two varieties of these four types of liberation: one, predominated by the desire for happiness and power, and the other, predominated by the desire for prema. The first variety is not accepted by those who are inclined to serve the Lord.

1.2.57
kintu premaika-madhurya-jusa ekantino harau |
naivangikurvate jatu muktim panca-vidham api || 57

But the devotees solely attached to the Lord who relish the sweetness of prema never accept the five types of liberation at all (even prema-uttara).

1.2.58
tatrapy ekantinam srestha govinda-hrita-manasah |
yesam srisa-prasado 'pi mano hartum na saknuyat  || 58

Among the devotees who are dedicated solely to serving the Lord in prema, the devotees whose hearts have been stolen by Govinda are the best. Even the kindness of the Narayana or other forms of Krisna cannot steal their hearts.

1.2.59
siddhantatas tv abhede 'pi srisa-krisna-svarupayoh |
rasenotkrisyate krisna-rupam esa rasa-sthitih || 59

Though the forms of Visnu and Krisna are non-different according to the statement of scriptures, Krisna’s form is shown to be superior because of His rasas, which are endowed with the highest type of prema. The very nature of His rasas shows Krisna’s form to be superior.

Chapter 5: purity of devotional service

1.2.60
kim ca:
sastratah sruyate bhaktau nri-matrasyadhikarita |
sarvadhikaritam magha-snanasya bruvata yatah |
dristantita vasisthena hari-bhaktir nripam prati || 60

Furthermore, the following should be understood:
The scriptures say that any human being is qualified for bhakti, just as everyone is qualified to take a bath during the month of Magha. Vasistha while speaking to the king has given that example concerning devotion to the Lord.

1.2.61
yatha padme -
sarve 'dhikarino hy atra hari-bhaktau yatha nripa || 61

In the Padma Purana it is said:
All are qualified for hari-bhakti, O king.

1.2.62
kasi-khande ca tatha -
antyaja api tad-rastre sankha-cakranka-dharinah |
samprapya vaisnavim diksam diksita iva sambabhuh || 62

In the Kasi-khanda it is said:
In that country, the outcastes, receiving Vaisnava initiation, wearing the marks of the conch and disk, shine like sacrificial priests.

1.2.63-4
apl ca -
ananusthanato doso bhakty-anganam prajayate |
na karmanam akaranad esa bhakty-adhikarinam || 63
nisiddhacarato daivat prayascittam tu nocitam |
iti vaisnava-sastranam rahasyam tad-vidam matam | 64

And, moreover, it is said:
The person qualified for bhakti is at fault for failing to perform all of the important angas of bhakti. But he is not at fault for failing to perform the duties of varna and asrama. If he, by chance, happens to commit some sin, there is no atonement prescribed for him. This is the opinion of those who know the secret of Vaisnava scriptures.

1.2.65
yatha ekadase -
sve sve 'dhikare ya nistha sa gunah parikititah |
viparyas tu dosah syad ubhayor esa niscayah || 65

Thus, in the Eleventh Canto it is said:
Steadiness in one’s own position is declared to be actual piety, whereas deviation from one’s position is considered impiety. In this way the two are definitely ascertained. SB 11.21.2

1.2.66
prathame -
tyaktva svadharmam caranambujam harer
bhajann apakko 'tha patet tato yadi |
yatra kva vabhadram abhud amusya kim
ko vyartha apto 'bhajatam sva-dharmatah || 66

In the First Canto it is said:
If someone gives up his occupational duties and works in Krisna consciousness and then falls down on account of not completing his work, what loss is there on his part? Moreover, what can one gain if one performs his occupational duties perfectly but does not worship the Lord. SB 1.5.17

1.2.67
ekadase -
ajnayaiva gunan dosan mayadistan api svakan |
dharman santyajya yah sarvan mam bhajet sa ca sattamah || 67

In the Eleventh Canto it is said:
He perfectly understands that the ordinary religious duties prescribed by Me in various Vedic scriptures possess favorable qualities that purify the performer, and he knows that neglect of such duties constitutes a discrepancy in one’s life. Having taken complete shelter at My lotus feet, however, a saintly person ultimately renounces such ordinary religious duties and worships Me alone. He is thus considered the best among all living entities. SB 11.11.32

1.2.68
tatraiva-
devarsi-hutapta-nrinam pitrnam
na kinkaro nayam rini  ca rajan |
sarvatmana yah saranam saranyam
gato mukundam parihritya kartam || 68

It is also stated there:
Anyone who has taken shelter of the lotus feet of Mukunda, the giver of liberation, giving up all kinds of obligations, and has taken to the path in all seriousness, owes neither duties nor obligations to the demigods, sages, general living entities, family members, humankind or forefathers. SB 11.5.41

1.2.69
sri-bhagavad-gitasu (18.66)-
sarva-dharman parityajya mam ekam saranam vraja |
aham tvam sarva-papebhyo moksayisyami ma sucah || 69

In the Bhagavad-gita it is said:
Giving up all dharmas, surrender to Me alone. I will deliver you from all sins. Do not worry. BG 18.66

1.2.70
agastya-samhitayam -
yatha vidhi-nisedhau tu muktam naivopasarpatah |
tatha na sprisato ramopasakam vidhi-purvakam || 70

In the Agastya-samhita it is said:
Just as the rules and prohibitions of the smriti scriptures do not approach a liberated person, the rules and prohibitions applicable to vaidika or tantrika worship also do not touch the worshipper of Rama.

1.2.71 ☀
ekadase eva -
sva-pada-mulam bhajatah priyasya
tyaktanya-bhavasya harih paresah |
vikarma yac cotpatitam kathancid
dhunoti sarvam hridi sannivistah ||71

And in the Eleventh Canto it is said:
One who thus given up all other engagements and has taken full shelter at the lotus feet of Hari, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is very dear to the Lord. Indeed, if such of surrendered soul accidentally commits some sinful activity, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is seated within everyone’s heart, immediately takes away the reactions of such sin. SB 11.5.42

Chapter 7 justification of the principles of devotional service

1.2.97
1. tatra guru-padasrayo, yatha ekadase - 
tasmad gurum prapadyeta jijnasuh sreya uttamam |
sabde pare ca nisnatam brahmany upasamasrayam || 97

Taking shelter of the lotus feet of guru (verse 74), from the Eleventh Canto: Therefore, any person who seriously desires real happiness must seek a spiritual master, who is conversant with the bhakti scriptures, accomplished in hearing and chanting about the Lord, and fully tranquil. SB 11.3.21

Accepting the bona fide spiritual master as one’s life and soul and worshipable deity, the disciple should learn from him the process of pure bhakti by sincere service. By that pure bhakti the Lord, the supreme soul, will be satisfied, and give Himself that devotee. SB 11.3.22

aikantiki harer bhaktir utpatayaiva kalpate || 101

Also, evidence from the Brahma-yamala:
Even if a person seems to have attained steadiness in practicing pure bhakti to the Lord, that bhakti is misfortune if it is rejects the rules of sruti, smriti, purana and pancaratra due to lack of faith in them.

1.2.102
bhaktir aikantiki veyam avicarat pratiyate |
vastutas tu tatha naiva yad asastriyateksyate || 102

na sangah salya-yuktanam nana-devaika-sevinam || 112

Also, from the Visnu-rahasya:

1.2.207-209
yatha skande -
vaisnavani tu sastrani ye srinvanti pathanti ca |
dhanyas te manava loke tesam krisnah prasidati || 207

vaisnavani tu sastrani ye 'rcayanti grihe narah |
sarva-papa-vinirmukta bhavanti sura-vanditah || 208

tisthate vaisnavam sastram likhitam yasya mandire |
tatra narayano devah svayam vasati narada || 209

From Skanda Purana:
O Narada, fortunate are those people in this world who hear and read the Vaisnava scriptures. Krisna is pleased with them. Those who worship the Vaisnava scriptures in their houses become free from all sins and are praised by the devatas. The Supreme Lord Narayana Himself lives in the house where the written Vaisnava scriptures have appeared.

1.2.210
tatha sri-bhagavate dvadase ca -
sarva-vedanta-saram hi sri-bhagavatam isyate |
tad-rasamrita-triptasya nanyatra syad ratih kvacit || 210

Also in the Twelfth Canto, service to the scripture illustrated:
Srimad-Bhagavatam is declared as the essence of all Vedanta philosophy. One who has felt satisfaction from its nectarean mellow will never be attracted to any other literature. SB 12.13.15

1.2.211
55. atha mathurayah, yatha adi-varahe -
mathuram ca parityajya yo 'nyatra kurute ratim |
mudho bhramati samsare mohita mama mayaya || 211

Serving Mathura and other holy places (verse 89), illustrated in the Varaha Purana:
The fool who gives up Mathura and develops attraction for some other place wanders in the material world birth after birth, bewildered by My maya.

1.2.212
brahmande ca -
trailokya-varti-tirthanam sevanad durlabha hi ya |
parananda-mayi siddhir mathura-sparsa-matratah || 212

This is also illustrated in the Brahmanda Purana:
The bliss at the stage of prema, which is rarely obtained even by serving all the holy places in the three worlds, is available just by touching Mathura.

1.2.213
sruta smrita kirtita ca vanchita preksita gata |
sprista srita sevita ca mathurabhista-da nrinam |
iti khyatam puranesu na vistara-bhiyocyate || 213

Hearing about, remembering, glorifying, desiring, seeing, visiting, touching, taking shelter, and serving Mathura fulfills all the desires of human beings. This has been described in all the Puranas. I have not elaborated this here for fear of increasing the volume of the book.

1.2.214 ☀
56. atha vaisnavanam sevanam, yatha padme (6.253.176) -
aradhananam sarvesam visnor aradhanam param |
tasmat parataram devi tadiyanam samarcanam || 214

Service to Vaisnavas (verse 89), from Padma Purana (6.253.176):
Of all types of worship, worship of Visnu is supreme. O Devi, worship of His devotees, however, is even superior to that.

1.2.215
tritiye ca -
yat-sevaya bhagavatah kuta-sthasya madhu-dvisah |
rati-raso bhavet tivrah padayor vyasanardanah || 215

In the Third Canto, it is said:
By serving the devotee, one will develop a fixed manifestation of bhava for the feet of the Personality of Godhead, possessed of an eternal form, the enemy of the Madhu demon. That bhava vanquishes one’s material distresses. SB 3.7.19

1.2.216
skande ca -
sankha-cakrankita-tanuh sirasa manjari-dharah |
gopi-candana-liptango dristas cet tad-agham kutah || 216

Also, the Skanda Purana says:
Where sin is for the person who has seen a Vaisnava whose body is marked with conch and disk, who has tulasi manjaris on his head and whose limbs are smeared with gopi-candana?

1.2.217
prathame (1.19.33) ca -
yesam samsmaranat pumsam sadyah suddhyanti vai grihah |
kim punar darsana-sparsa-pada-saucasanadibhih || 217

The First Canto says:
Simply by our remembering You, our houses become instantly sanctified. And what speak of seeing You, touching You, washing Your holy feet and offering You a seat in our home?

1.2.218 ☀
adi-purane -
ye me bhakta-janah partha na me bhaktas ca te janah |
mad-bhaktanam ca ye bhaktas te me bhaktatama matah || 218

Adi-purana says:
Those who claim to be My devotees are not My devotees. Those who are the devotees of My devotees, I consider them to be My best devotees.

1.2.219
yavanti bhagavad-bhakter angani kathitaniha |
prayas tavanti tad-bhakta-bhakter api budha viduh || 219

All the angas of bhakti described in relation to the Lord are also angas in relation to the devotees of the Lord. This is the conclusion of the wise.

1.2.220
57. atha yatha-vaibhava-mahotsavo, yatha padme -
yah karoti mahipala harer gehe mahotsavam |
tasyapi bhavati nityam hari-loke mahotsavah || 220

Observing festivals according to ones wealth (verse 89), illustrated from the Padma Purana:
O king, he who performs a festival for the temple of the Lord experiences for eternity a festival in the planet of the Lord.

1.2.221
58. atha urjadaro, yatha padme -
yatha damodaro bhakta-vatsalo vidito janaih |
tasyayam tadriso masah svalpam apy uru-karakah || 221

Observing Urja-vrata (verse 90), from the Padma Purana:
Just as men know that Damodara is affectionate to His devotee, the Damodara month is also affectionate to the devotee. Even a little service performed during that month yields great results.

1.2.222-223
tatrapi mathurayam visesah -
bhuktim muktim harir dadyad arcito nyatra sevinam |
bhaktim tu na dadaty eva yato vasyakari hareh || 222

sa tv anjasa harer bhaktir labhyate kartike naraih |
mathurayam sakrid api sri-damodara sevanat || 223

Respecting the Damodara-vrata in Mathura is glorified in the Padma Purana:
The Lord, being worshipped elsewhere, awards material enjoyment and liberation to those worshippers. He does not give bhakti because bhakti controls the Lord. However, men can achieve bhakti to the Lord very easily by serving Damodara during Kartika month in Mathura just once.

1.2.224
59. atha sri-janma-dina-yatra, yatha bhavisyottare -
yasmin dine prasuteyam devaki tvam janardana |
tad-dinam bruhi vaikuntha kurmas te tatra cotsavam |
tena samyak-prapannanam prasadam kuru kesavah || 224

Observing the appearance day of the Lord (verse 90), from the Bhavisyottara Purana:
O Janardana, Tell us the day that Devaki gave birth to You. O Vaikuntha, We will perform a festival on that day. O Kesava, may You be pleased with that festival performed by those who are completely surrendered to You.

1.2.225
60. atha-sri-murter-anghri-sevane pritih, yatha adi-purane -

61. atha sri-bhagavatarthasvado, yatha prathame -
nigama-kalpa-taror-galitam phalam
suka-mukhad amrita-drava-samyutam |
pibata bhagavatam rasam alayam
muhur aho rasika bhuvi bhavukah || 226

Relishing Bhagavatam (verse 91), from the First Canto:
O expert and thoughtful men, relish Srimad-Bhagavatam, the mature fruit of the desire tree of Vedic literatures. It emanated from the lips of Sri Sukadeva Gosvami. Therefore, this fruit has become even more tasteful, although its nectarean juice was already relishable for all, including liberated souls. SB 1.1.3

1.2.227
tatha dvitiye ca -
parinistito 'pi nairgunye uttamahsloka-lilaya |
grihita-ceta rajarse akhyanam yad adhitavan || 227

In similar way, it is said in the Second Canto:
O saintly King, I was certainly situated perfectly in transcendence, yet I was still attracted by the delineation of the pastimes of the Lord, who is described by enlightened verses. SB 2.1.9

1.2.228
62. atha sa-jatiyasaya-snigdha-sri-bhagavad-bhakta-sango, yatha prathame -
tulayama lavenapi na svargam napunar-bhavam |
bhagavat-sangi-sangasya martyanam kim utasisah || 228

Association with like-minded, affectionate devotees (verse 91), illustrated in the First Canto:
The value of a moment’s association with the devotee of the Lord cannot be compared even to the attainment of heavenly planets or liberation from matter. What, then, to speak of worldly benedictions in the form of material prosperity, which are meant for those who are destined to die. SB 1.18.13

1.2.229
hari-bhakti-sudhodaye ca -
yasya yat-sangatih pumso manivat syat sa tad-gunah |
sva-kula-rddhyai tato dhiman sva-yuthan eva samsrayet || 229

It is also said in the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya:
A man will attain the qualities of the person with whom he associates, just as a crystal takes up the color of the object next to it. Therefore, the wise man will take shelter of those who have qualities like his own for the prosperity of his family.

1.2.230
63. atha sri-nama samkirtanam, yatha dvitiye (2.1.11) -
etan nirvidyamananam icchatam akuto-bhayam |
yoginam nripa nirnitam harer namanukirtanam || 230

Chanting the name of the Lord (verse 92), from the second Canto:
O King, constant chanting of the holy name of the Lord after the ways of the great authorities is the doubtless and fearless way of success for all, including those who are free from all material desires, those who are desirous of all material enjoyment, and also those who are self-satisfied by dint of transcendental knowledge. SB 2.1.11

1.2.231
adi-purane ca -
gitva ca mama namani vicaren mama  sannidhau |
iti vravimi te satyam krito 'ham tasya carjuna || 231

In the Adi Purana it is said:
By singing My names, a person will attain a position close to Me. I make this promise. That person, O Arjuna, purchases me.

1.2.232
padme ca -
yena janma-sahasrani vasudevo nisevitah |
tan-mukhe hari-namani sada tisthanti bharata || 232

In the Padma Purana it is said:
The names of the Lord remain constantly in the mouth of that person who serves Vasudeva for a thousand births.

1.2.233 ☀
yatas tatraiva -
nama  cintamanih krisnas caitanya-rasa-vigrahah |
purnah suddho nitya-mukto 'bhinnatvan nama-naminoh || 233

It is also said in the Padma Purana:
The name of the Lord fulfills all desires like cintamani. It is very form of Krisna. It is full of consciousness and rasa. It is complete, pure, and eternally liberated. This is because of the non-difference of the name and Krisna.

1.2.234 ☀
yatha tatraiva -
atah sri-krisna-namadi na bhaved grahyam indriyaih |
sevonmukhe hi jihvadau svayam eva sphuraty adah || 234

Also from the Padma Purana:
Krisna and His names cannot be grasped by the material senses, but when a person develops the tendency to accept the Lord’s name and form, Krisna then spontaneously appears on the tongue and in the other senses.

1.2.235-237
(64) atha sri-mathura-mandale sthitih, yatha padme -
anyesu punya-tirthesu muktir eva maha-phalam |
muktaih prarthya harer bhaktir mathurayam tu labhyate || 235

tri-vargada kaminam ya mumuksunam ca moksada |
bhakticchor bhaktida kas tam mathuram nasrayed budhah || 236

aho madhu-puri dhanya vaikunthac ca gariyasi |
dinam ekam nivasena harau bhaktih prajayate || 237

Residing in Mathura (verse 92), illustrated in the Padma Purana:
Liberation is the greatest result that can be obtained at other holy places, but devotion to the Lord, which is desired by the liberated souls, can be attained at Mathura. Mathura bestows dharma, artha, kama to those desiring liberation. It awards bhakti to those desiring bhakti. What intelligent person will not take shelter of Mathura? Oh, Mathura is most auspicious, and greater than Vaikuntha (Goloka)! By staying only one day in Mathura, bhakti to the Lord appears.

Chapter 13

1.2.238
duruhadbhuta-virye 'smin sraddha dure 'stu pancake |
yatra svalpo 'pi sambandhah sad-dhiyam bhava-janmane || 238

The last five items (verse 90-92) have inconceivable and astonishing power. What to speak of having faith in these items, if there is just a little relationship with these items, persons who are devoid of offenses can attain the level of bhava.

1.2.239
tatra sri-murtih yatha -
smeram bhangi-traya-paricitam saci-vistirna-dristim
vamsi-nyastadhara-kisalayam ujjvalam candrakena |
govindakhyam hari-tanum itah kesi-tirthopakanthe
ma preksisthas tava yadi sakhe bandhu-sange 'sti rangah || 239

The power of serving the deity:
O my friend, if you desire to enjoy with your friends and relatives, then do not look upon the form of the Lord called Govinda wandering near Kesi-tirtha on the bank of the Yamuna river, with a slight smile on His lips, posed with three bends in His body, eyes glancing everywhere in a crooked fashion, flute placed on His red lower lip like a tender bud, and shining gloriously with a peacock feather.

1.2.240
sri bhagavatam yatha -
sanke nitah  sapadi dasama-skandha-padyavalinam
varnah karnadhvani pathikatam anupurvyad bhavadbhih |
hamho dimbhah parama-subhadan hanta dharmartha-kaman
yad garhantah sukhamayam ami moksam apy aksipanti || 240

The power of hearing Bhagavatam:
O idiots, how unfortunate you are! I think that you must have been hearing all the syllables, one by one, of the verses of the Tenth Canto of Bhagavatam, because your ears are now denouncing the most auspicious goals of dharma, artha and kama, and even decrying the fourth goal of liberation which is most blissful.

1.2.241
krisna-bhakto yatha -
drig-ambhobhir dhautah pulaka-patali mandita-tanuh
skhalann antah-phullo dadhad atiprithum vepathum api |
drisoh kaksam yavan mama sa purusah ko 'py upayayau
na jane kim tavan matir iha grihe nabhiramate || 241

The power of association with the devotee of Krisna:
Ever since I saw a certain person whose body was washed with his own tears, whose hairs were standing on end, and who stumbled around with a joyous heart, while quivering to the extreme, my mind has for some reason become so attached to the form of Krisna that I have no attachment to my family.

1.2.242
nama yatha -
yadavadhi mama sita vainikenanugita
sruti-patham agha-satror nama-gatha prayata |
anavakalita-purvam hanta kam apy avastham
tadavadhi dadhad-antar-manasam samyativa || 242

The power of chanting the name of the Lord:
Ever since I have heard Narada singing the names of Krisna, which pacify the ears, my heart has become completely blissful, fixed in an unprecedented state of prema.

1.2.243
sri mathura-mandalam yatha -
tata-bhuvi krita-kantih syamala yas tatinyah
sphutita-nava-kadambalambi-kujad-dvirepha |
niravadhi-madhurimna manditeyam katham me
manasi kam api bhavam kanana-sris tanoti || 243

The power of residing in the district of Mathura:
The splendor of Mathura’s forest made beautiful by being situated on the bank of the Yamuna, where buzzing bees take shelter of newly blooming kadamba trees, ornamented with unlimited sweetness, produces an extraordinary state of bhava in my mind.

1.2.244
alaukika-padarthanam acintya saktir idrisi |
bhavam tad-visayam capi ya sahaiva prakasayet || 244

The inconceivable power of these extraordinary five angas is such that it will manifest the state of bhava and its object, Krisna, at the same time.

1.2.245
kesamcit kvacid anganam yat ksudram sruyate phalam |
bahir-mukha-pravrittyaitat kintu mukhyam phalam ratih || 245

In some of the verses quoted from the scriptures, material results are attributed to the angas for attracting persons possessing material consciousness. However, the main result of these angas is rati (bhava).

1.2.246 ☀
sammatam bhakti-vijnanam bhakty-angatvam na karmanam || 246

The consensus of those knowledgeable of bhakti is that karma (varnasrama duties) is not an anga of bhakti.

1.2.247
yatha caikadase -
tavat karmani kurvita na nirvidyeta yavata |
mat-katha-sravanadau va sraddha yavan na jayate || 247

In the Eleventh Canto it is explained:
One should continue to perform the daily and periodic varnasrama activities until one actually becomes detached from material sense gratification and develops faith for hearing and chanting about Me. SB 11.20.9

Chapter 14

1.2.248 ☀
jnana-vairagyayor bhakti-pravesayopayogita |
isat prathamam eveti nangatvam ucitam tayoh || 248

Jnana and vairagya are suitable for entering bhakti, being somewhat useful in the beginning of bhakti, but they are not considered angas of bhakti.

1.2.249 ☀
yad ubhe citta-kathinya-hetu prayah satam mate |
sukumara-svabhaveyam bhaktis tad-hetur irita || 249

Because jnana and vairagya generally make the heart harsh, the authoritative devotees have concluded that bhakti alone, whose nature is very tender, is the cause of entering into bhakti.

1.2.250
yatha tatraiva -
tasman mad-bhakti yuktasya yogino vai mad-atmanah |
na jnanam na ca vairagyam prayah sreyo bhaved iha || 250

In the Bhagavatam, it is also said:
Therefore, for a devotee engaged in My loving service, with mind fixed on Me, the cultivation of knowledge (impersonal) and renunciation is generally not the means of achieving the highest perfection within this world. SB 11.20.31

1.2.251 ☀
kintu jnana-virakty-adi-sadhyam bhaktyaiva sidhyati || 251

However, the goals of jnana, vairagya and other processes are achieved by bhakti alone.

1.2.252-253
yatha tatraiva -
yat karmabhir yat tapasa jnana-vairagyatas ca yat |
yogena dana dharmena sreyobhir itarair api || 252

sarvam mad-bhakti-yogena mad-bhakto labhate 'njasa |
svargapavargam mad-dhama kathancid yadi vanchati || 253

Thus, it is said in Bhagavatam:
Everything that can be achieved by fruitive activities, penance, knowledge, detachment, mystic yoga, charity, religious duties and all other means of perfecting life is easily achieved by My devotee through loving service unto Me. If somehow or other My devotee desires promotion to heaven, liberation, or residence in My abode (for service), he easily achieves such benedictions. SB 11.20.32-33

1.2.254
rucim udvahatas tatra janasya bhajane hareh |
visayesu garistho 'pi ragah prayo viliyate || 254

If a person has a taste for worshipping the Lord, even if he has strong material attractions, those attractions will be for the most part destroyed during sadhana without resorting to vairagya.

1.2.255 ☀
anasaktasya visayan yatharham upayunjatah |
nirbandhah krisna-sambandhe yuktam vairagyam ucyate || 255

The vairagya of that person who employs objects suitable for devotional development, while remaining detachment from them, is said to be suitable for bhakti. The objects should be persistently related to Krisna.

1.2.256 ☀
prapancikataya buddhya hari-sambandhi-vastunah |
mumuksubhih parityago vairagyam phalgu kathyate || 256

Rejection of things related to the Lord by persons desiring liberation, who think that these things are simply material objects, is called useless vairagya.

1.2.257-258
proktena laksanenaiva bhakter adhikritasya ca |
angatve suniraste 'pi nityady-akhila-karmanam || 257

jnanasyadhyatmikasyapi vairagyasya ca phalgunah |
spastatartham punar api tad evedam nirakritam  || 258

The daily and periodic duties of varnasrama and the impersonal aspect of jnana (the obstructive portions of karma and jnana) have already been rejected as angas of bhakti by using the stated definition of uttama-bhakti obtained through the bhakti scriptures. However, in order to make the point clear, the false type of vairagya (the obstructive portion) has been again rejected as an anga of bhakti.

1.2.259
dhana-sisyadibhir dvarair ya bhaktir upapadyate |
vidurtvad uttamata-hanya tasyas ca nangata || 259

That bhakti which is accomplished by dependence on wealth, followers or other objects cannot be considered as an anga of uttama-bhakti because it destroys the pure nature of that bhakti. It is situated far way from uttama-bhakti.

1.2.260
visesanatvam evaisam samsrayanty adhikarinam |
vivekadiny ato 'misam api nangatvam ucyate || 260

Discrimination and other material qualities cannot be considered as angas of uttama-bhakti, since on their own they take shelter of the excellent condition of persons practicing uttama-bhakti.

1.2.261 ☀
krisnanmukham svayam yanti yamah saucadayas tatha |
ity esam ca na yukta syad bhakty-angantara-patita || 261

Basic rules of conduct (yamah), rules of cleanliness and other actions appear automatically in those who are extremely dedicated to Krisna. Thus, they are not included as angas of bhakti.

1.2.262
yatha skande -
ete na hy adbhuta vyadha tavahimsadayo gunah |
hari-bhaktau pravritta ye na te syuh para-tapinah || 262

Thus in the Skanda Purana, it is said:
O hunter! These qualities such as non-violence are not astonishing, because the persons who engage in devotional to the Lord will never cause affliction to others.

1.2.263
tatraiva -
antah-suddhir bahih-suddhis tapah-santy-adayas tatha |
ami gunah prapadyante hari-sevabhikaminam || 263

Also in the Skanda Purana, it is said:
Internal and external purity, austerity (sense control), peacefulness and other qualities take shelter of persons who desire to serve the Lord.

1.2.264 ☀
sa bhaktir eka-mukhyangasritanaikangi katha va |
sva-vasananusarena nisthatah siddhi-krid bhavet || 264

Bhakti, taking shelter of one principal anga or many angas according to one’s desire, and practiced with steadiness, brings about the desired result (bhava and prema).

1.2.265
tatra ekanga, yatha granthantare -
sri visnoh sravane pariksid abhavad vaiyasakih kirtane
prahladah smarane tad-anghri-bhajane laksmih prithuh pujane |
akruras tv abhivandane kapi-patir dasye 'tha sakhya 'rjunah
sarvasvatma-nivedane balir abhut krisnaptir esam param || 265

Examples of practicing one anga are illustrated in another work:
Pariksit is an example of hearing about the Lord and Sukadeva is an example of chanting the glories of the Lord. Prahlada is an example of remembering the Lord and Laksmi is an example of serving the lotus feet of the Lord. Prithu is an example of performing deity worship of the Lord. Akrura is an example of attaining perfection by offering prayers to the Lord. Hanuman is an example of serving with attitude of a servant of the Lord. Arjuna is an example of friendship with the Lord. Bali is an example of offering the self to the Lord. They achieved Krisna by following principally one anga.

1.2.266-268
anekanga, yatha navame -
sa vai manah krisna-padaravindayor
vacamsi vaikuntha-gunanuvarnane |
karau harer mandira-marjanadisu
srutim cakaracyuta-sat-kathodaye || 266

padau hareh ksetra-padanusarpane
siro hrisikesa-padabhivandane |
kamam ca dasye na tu kama-kamyaya
yathottamahsloka-janasraya ratih || 268

An example of practicing many angas equally is found in the Ninth Canto:
Maharaja Ambarisa always engaged his mind in meditating upon the lotus feet of Krisna, his words in describing the glories of the Lord, his hands in cleansing the Lord’s temple, and his ears in hearing the words spoken by Krisna or about Krisna. He engaged his eyes in seeing the Deity of Krisna, Krisna’s temple and Krisna’s places like Mathura and Vrindavana, he engaged his sense of touch in touching the bodies of the Lord’s devotees, he engaged his sense of smell in smelling the fragrance of tulasi offered to the Lord, and he engaged his tongue in tasting the Lord’s prasada. He engaged his legs in walking to the holy places and temples of the Lord, his head in bowing down before the Lord, and his desires in serving the Lord, twenty-four hours a day. Indeed, Maharaja Ambarisa never desired anything for his own sense gratification. He engaged all his senses in devotional service, in various engagements related to the Lord. This is the way to increase attachment for the Lord and be completely free from all material desires. SB 9.4.18-20

1.2.269
sastroktaya prabalaya tat-tan-maryadayanvita |
vaidhi bhaktir iyam kaiscan maryada-marga ucyate || 269

Some persons call vaidhi-bhakti the path of rules (maryada-marga), since it is bound by strong limitations of the rules mentioned in the scriptures.

Chapter 15
atha raganuga

1.2.270
virajantim abhivyaktam vraja-vasi janadisu |
ragatmikam anusrita ya sa raganugocyate || 270

Raganuga-bhakti is defined as that bhakti which follows after the ragatmika-bhakti found distinctively in the inhabitants of Vraja.

1.2.271
raganuga-vivekartham adau ragatmikocyate || 271

In order to define raganuga-bhakti first ragatmika-bhakti should be discussed.

1.2.272 ☀
iste svarasiki ragah paramavistata bhavet |
tan-mayi ya bhaved bhaktih satra ragatmikodita || 272

Raga is defined as spontaneous, deep thirst for the object of love. Bhakti that is impelled exclusively by such a thirst is called ragatmika-bhakti.

1.2.273
sa kamarupa sambandha-rupa ceti bhaved dvidha || 273

There are two types of ragatmika-bhakti: that impelled by conjugal feelings (kama-rupa) and that impelled by other relationships (sambandha-rupa).

1.2.274
tatha hi saptame -
kamad dvesad bhayat snehad yatha bhaktyesvare manah |
avesya tad agham hitva bahavas tad-gatim  gatah || 274

These two types of ragatmika-bhakti are illustrated in the Seventh Canto:
Just as by vaidhi-bhakti one can attain one’s spiritual goals, many persons have attained suitable forms, according to their type of absorption, after absorbing their minds in the Lord out of lust, hatred, fear and affection, and after giving up their sinful mentality (in the case of hatred and fear). SB 7.1.30

My dear King Yudhisthira, the gopis by their conjugal desires, Kamsa by his fear, Sisupala and other kings by envy, the Vrisnis of Vraja (see footnote 43) by their relationship with Krisna, you Pandavas by your great affection for Krisna, and we (Narada), by our vaidhi-bhakti, have obtained the mercy of Krisna. SB 7.1.31

1.2.275
gopyah kamad bhayat kamso dvesac caidyadayo nripah |
sambandhad vrisnayah snehad yuyam bhaktya vayam vibho || 275

1.2.276-277
anukulya-viparyasad bhiti-dvesau parahatau |
snehasya sakhya-vacitvad vaidha-bhakty-anuvartita || 276

kim va premabhidhayitvan nopayogo'tra sadhane |
bhaktya vayam iti vyaktam vaidhi bhaktir udirita || 277

Because fear and hatred are not favorable, they are rejected as modes of bhakti. Affection (sneha) of the Pandavas, if it means friendliness (sakhya), belongs to vaidhi-bhakti (because the sakhya is predominated by veneration). If sneha means prema or a stage of prema, it still could not be admitted here, as the topic is sadhana-bhakti. In the phrase “bhaktya vayam” (and we, the sages (Narada), attained befitting goals by bhakti), bhakti refers to vaidhi-bhakti.

1.2.278
yad-arinam priyanam ca prapyam ekam ivoditam |
tad brahma-krisnayor aikyakt kiranarkopama-jusoh || 278

When it is said that the enemies and the dear friends of the Lord attained the same end, it means the same end only in the sense that brahman and the personal form of Krisna are one entity, in the manner that the rays of the sun and the sun are one.

1.2.279
brahmany eva layam yanti prayena ripavo hareh |
kecit prapyapi sarupyabhasam majjanti tat-sukhe || 279

The enemies of the Lord generally merge into the impersonal brahman. Some of them, even though they attain semblance of a form similar to the Lord’s (sarupyabhasam), remain absorbed in the happiness of brahman.

1.2.280
tatha ca brahmanda purane -
siddha-lokas tu tamasah pare yatra vasanti hi |
siddha brahma-sukhe magna daityas ca harina hatah || 280

Moreover, it says in the Brahmanda Purana:
Siddha-loka (the spiritual world) is beyond the prakriti. There, demons killed by the Lord and some sages dwell, merged in the happiness of brahman.

1.2.281
raga-bandhena kenapi tam bhajanto vrajanty ami |
anghri-padma-sudhah prema-rupas tasya priya janah || 281

Those persons most devoted to the Lord, who are very form of prema and who worship Him with intense, spontaneous absorption, attain the nectar of His lotus feet.

1.2.282
tatha hi srs-dasame -
nibhrita-marun-mano 'ksa-dridha-yoga-yujo hridi yan
munaya upasate tad-arayo 'pi yayuu smaranat |
striya uragendra-bhoga-bhuja-danda-visakta-dhiyo
vayam api te samah sama-driso 'nghri-saroja-sudhah || 282

Thus, it says in the Tenth Canto:
Simply by constantly thinking of Him, the enemies of the Lord attain the same brahman that sages fixed in yoga worship by controlling their breath, mind and senses. Similarly, the srutis, adopting the mood similar to the gopis, and finally attaining similar bodies, will achieve the same nectar from Your lotus feet that Your consorts are able to relish because of their loving attraction to Your mighty, serpentine arms. SB 10.87.23

1.2.283
tatha kamarupa -
sa kamarupa sambhoga-trisnam ya nayati svatam |
yad asyam krisna-saukhyartham eva kevalam udyamah || 283

Here is the definition of kamarupa-ragatmika-bhakti:
That type of bhakti with full absorption in the beloved is called kama-rupa-bhakti which produces an intrinsic thirst for a conjugal relationship with the Lord in the atma. It is called bhakti because in that condition there is only eagerness for giving pleasure to Krisna.

1.2.284
iyam tu vraja-devisu suprasiddha virajate |
asam prema-viseso 'yam praptah kam api madhurim |
tat-tat-krida-nidanatvat kama ity ucyate budhaih || 284

This very form kama-rupa-bhakti appears with brilliance in the women of Vraja. They have a particular type of prema which has a special sweetness. It is called kama by the wise because it is the cause of various amorous actions.

1.2.285
tatha ca tantre -
premaiva gopa-ramanam kama ity  agamat pratham || 285

Thus, in a tantra it is said:
The kama-rupa-bhakti of the gopis has become famous simply as prema.

1.2.286
ity uddhavadayo 'py etam vanchati bhagavat-priyah || 286

And, because it is a form of exalted prema, persons such as Uddhava, dear to the Lord, desire that aspect of it.

1.2.287
kama-praya ratih kintu kubjayam eva sammata || 287

But the wise agree that the attraction to Krisna seen in Kubja is essentially due to kama only.

Chapter 16

1.2.288
tatra sambandha-rupa -
sambandha-rupa govinde pitritvady-abhimanita |
atropalaksanataya vrisninam vallava matah |
yadaisya-jnana-sunyatvad esam rage pradhanata || 288

Next sambandha-rupa-ragatmika-bhakti will be discussed:
Sambandha-rupa-ragatmika-bhakti is that bhakti inspired by great absorption arising from identifying oneself as the parent, friend or servant of Govinda. This refers to the bhakti of the cowherd people, which is indicated by the word, sambandhad vrisnayah, quoted in verse 175 as an example of sambandha. This is because these other relationships in Vraja also have a predominance of intense affection (raga), caused by a lack of awareness of Krisna as God.

1.2.289
kama-sambandha-rupe te prema-matra-svarupake |
nitya-siddhasrayataya natra samyag vicarite || 289

Since kama-rupa and sambandha-rupa-bhakti, which are caused by prema alone, take shelter of the nitya-siddhas, they have not been discussed in this section thoroughly.

1.2.290

tat-tad-bhavadi-madhurye srute dhir yad apeksate |
natra sastram na yuktim ca tal-lobhotpatti-laksanam || 292

The appearance of that greed is indicated when the intelligence does not depend on rules of scriptures and logic, after realizing to some degree the sweetness of their (inhabitants of Vraja) love through the process of hearing from the scriptures.

The elements of kamanuga will be described:
That raganuga-sadhana-bhakti which is filled with longing and which follows after the kama-rupa-ragatmika-bhakti of the siddha-bhaktas, is called kamanuga-bhakti. There are two types: sambogeccha-mayi and tad-tad-bhavecchatma.

1.2.299
keli-tatparyavaty eva sambhogeccha-mayi bhavet |
tad-bhavecchatmika tasam bhava-madhurya-kamita || 299

purane sruyate padme pumsam api bhaved iyam || 300

Those who develop longing for the bhava of the gopis after seeing the sweetness in the deity of Krisna and the gopis, or after hearing about His pastimes with the gopis, are qualified for sadhana of either of these types of kamanuga-bhakti.

Examples of males becoming gopis are as follows:
Previously, all the sages living in Dandakaranya forest, who after seeing Lord Rama, desired enjoyment with His form, attained forms of women and appeared in Gokula. Attaining the Lord by that kama, they became liberated from the ocean of the material world.

Chapter 17

The Third Wave Concerning Bhava-bhakti 
In the Eastern Section of Bhakti-rasamrita-sindhu

1.3.1
suddha-sattva-visesatma prema-suryamsu-samya-bhak |
rucibhis citta-masrnya-krd asau bhava ucyate || 1 

That part of bhakti is called bhava, whose essence in samvit and hladini sakti, which is one ray of the sun of prema which will soon rise in the heart, and which softens the heart with desire to meet, serve, and exchange love with the Lord.

1.3.2
tatha hi tantre -
premnas tu prathamavastha bhava ity abhidhiyate |
sattvikah svalpa-matrah syur atrasru-pulakadayah || 2

In a tantra, it is said:
The preliminary state of prema is called bhava. There are a few sattvika-bhavas such as tears in the eyes and hairs standing on end.

1.3.3
sa yatha padma-purane -
dhyayam dhyayam bhagavatah padambuja-yugam tada |
isad-vikriyamanatma sardra-drstir abhud asau || 3

An example of sattvika-bhavas appearing at this stage, from the Padma Purana:
Continually meditating on the lotus feet of the Lord, Ambarisa developed slight transformations of the heart and tears in his eyes.

1.3.4-5
avirbhuya mano-vrttau vrajanti tat-svarupatam |
svayam-prakasa-rupapi bhasamana prakasyavat || 4

vastutah svayam asvada-svarupaiva ratis tv asau |
krsnadi-karmakasvada-hetutvam pratipadyate || 5

Appearing in the mental functions, bhava becomes the mental state itself. Though bhava is self-revealing, it appears to become manifest by the mind. Though in its essential nature bhava is taste itself, it also acts as a cause of tasting the pastimes of Krisna, His associates and His pastimes.

1.3.6
sadhanabhinivesena krsna-tad-bhaktayos tatha |
prasadenati-dhanyanam bhavo dvedhabhijayate |
adyas tu prayikas tatra dvitiyo viralodayah || 6

Bhava appears in very fortunate persons in two ways: by absorption in sadhana or by the mercy of Krisna or His devotee. Its appearance by sadhana is normal, and its appearance by mercy is rare.

1.3.7-8
tatra sadhanabhinivesa-jah -
vaidhi-raganuga-marga-bhedena parikirtitah I 
dvividhah khalu bhavo 'tra sadhanabhinivesajah || 7

sadhanabhinivesas tu tatra nispadayan rucim I 
harav asaktim utpadya ratim samjanayaty asau || 8

Bhava, arising from absorption in sadhana, will be discussed first: Bhava arising from sadhana has two types: arising from vaidhi-sadhana, and arising from raganuga-sadhana. Absorption in sadhana (nistha) produces ruci, then asakti, and then rati or bhava for the Lord.

1.3.9
tatra adyo -
tatranvaham krsna-kathah pragayatam
anugrahenasrnavam manoharah |
tah sraddhaya me 'nupadam visrnvatah
priya-sravasy anga mamabhavad ratih II 9

Bhava arising from vaidhi-sadhana is illustrated:
O Vyasadeva, in that association, and by the mercy of those great Vedantists, I could hear them describe the activities of Lord Krisna. These because very attractive (ruci). Thus, listening attentively (asakti), rati for the Personality of Godhead appeared. SB 1.5.26

1.3.10
ratya tu bhava evatra na tu premabhidhiyate I 
mama bhaktih pravrtteti vaksyate sa yad agratah || 10

The word rati in the Bhagavatam verse indicates bhava, not prema, because, two verses later, the appearance of prema is indicated with the words “My bhakti (prema) the appeared.”

1.3.11
yatha tatraiva - 
ittham sarat-pravrsikav rtu harer
visrnvato me 'nusavam yaso 'malam |
sankirtyamanam munibhir mahatmabhir
bhaktih pravrttatma rajas-tamopaha || 11 

There it is also said:
Thus during two seasons - the rainy season and autumn - I had the opportunity to hear these great-souled sages constantly chant the unadulterated glories of the Lord Hari. As the flow of my prema appeared, the coverings of the modes of passion and ignorance vanished. SB 1.5.28

1.3.12
tritiye ca -
satam prasangan mama virya-samvido 
bhavanti hrt-karna-rasayanah kathah |
taj-josanad asv apavarga-vartmani 
sraddha ratir bhaktir anukramisyati || 12

In the Third Canto, there is a similar usage of the word bhakti:
In the association of pure devotees, discussion of the pastimes and activities of the Supreme Personality of Godhead is very pleasing and satisfying to the ear and the heart. By cultivating such knowledge, one gradually develops faith, rati and prema for Krisna. SB 3.25.25

1.3.13
purane natya-sastre ca dvayos tu rati-bhavayoh |
samanarthataya hy atra dvayam aikyena laksitam || 13

In the puranas and Natya-sastra, rati and bhava have the same meaning. Thus, in this work, they will have the same meaning.

1.3.14
dvitiyo, yatha padme -
ittham manoratham bala kurvatI nrtya utsuka |
hari-pritya ca tam sarvam ratrim evatyavahayat || 14

Bhava arising from raganuga-sadhana is illustrated in the Padma Purana:
A young girl, having great joy in the heart and being very enthusiastic to dance, spent the whole night dancing in order to please the Lord. 

1.3.15
atha sri-krsna-tad-bhakta-prasadajah -
sadhanena vina yas tu sahasaivabhijayate |
sa bhavah krsna-tad-bhakta-prasadaja itIyate || 15

Now, bhava arising from the mercy of Krisna or His devotee is defined:
That bhava which appears suddenly without performance of sadhana is known as bhava produced from the mercy of Krisna or His devotee.

1.3.16
atha sri-krsna-prasadajah  -
prasada vacikaloka-dana-hardadayo hareh || 16

Bhava arising from Krisna’s mercy is now considered:
This mercy arises from the words of the Lord, the presence of the Lord, or just appears in the heart.

1.3.17
tatra vacika-prasadajah, yatha naradiye -
sarva-mangala-murdhanya purnananda-mayi sada |
dvijendra tava mayy astu bhaktir avyabhicarini || 17

Verbal mercy is shown in the Naradiya Purana:
O best of the brahmanas, may you have undeviating bhakti (bhava) for Me. That bhakti is the crest jewel of all auspiciousness and full of bliss eternally.

1.3.18
aloka-danajah, yatha skande -
adrsta-purvam alokya krsnam jangala-vasinah |
viklidyad-antaratmano drstim nakrastum isire || 18

Giving mercy by showing Himself, is illustrated in the Skanda Purana:
When they saw Krisna, who appeared like nothing they had seen before, the hearts of the residents of Jangala melted and they could not take their eyes away from His form.

1.3.19
hardah -
prasada antaro yah syat sa harda iti kathyate || 19

The definition of harda is given:
That mercy which arises from within is called harda. 

1.3.20
yatha suka-samhitayam -
mahabhagavato jatah putras te badarayana |
vinopayair upeyabhud visnu-bhaktir ihodita || 20

Thus, it is said in the Suka-samhita:
O Badarayana, You have given birth to a great devotee as your son. Without sadhana, which brings about the goal, bhakti to Visnu has appeared within his heart.

1.3.21
atha tad-bhakta-prasadajah, yatha saptame -
gunair alam asankhyeyair mahatmyam tasya sucyate |
vasudeve bhagavati yasya naisargiki ratih || 21

Bhava arising from the devotee’s mercy is explained in the Seventh Canto:
Who could list the innumerable transcendental qualities of Prahlada Maharaja? He had unflinching faith in Vasudeva, Lord Krisna, and unalloyed devotion to Him. His rati to Lord Krisna was naisargiki, through mercy. Although his good qualities cannot be enumerated, they prove that he was a great soul. SB 7.4.36

1.3.22
naradasya prasadena prahlade subha-vasana |
nisargah saiva tenatra ratir naisargiki mata || 22

Favor or nisarga was granted to Prahlada by Narada and his created devotional impressions. Thus his rati is called naisargiki (through mercy).

1.3.23
skande ca -
aho dhanyo 'si devarse krpaya yasya tat-ksanat |
nico 'py utpulako lebhe lubdhako ratim acyute || 23 

Bhava arising by a devotee’s mercy is also illustrated in the Skanda Purana:
O Narada, you are noble. By your mercy the hunter, though low in nature, immediately developed goose bumps and attained rati for Lord Acyuta.

1.3.24
bhaktanam bhedatah seyam ratih panca-vidha mata |
agre vivicya vaktavya tena natra prapancyate || 24

According to the different types of devotees (with five different sthayi-bhavas), there are five different types of rati. These will be considered and explained later, and thus will not be discussed here.

asa-bandhah samutkantha nama-gane sada ruchi || 25

asaktis tad-gunakhyane pritis tad-vasati-sthale |
ity adyo 'nubhavah syur jata-bhavankure jane || 26 

The anubhavas or characteristics of a person who has developed the bud of bhava are as follows: tolerance, not wasting time, detachment from enjoyment, pridelessness, confidence in the Lord’s mercy, longing for the Lord, taste for chanting the name of the Lord, attachment to discussing about the Lord’s qualities, and attachment to living in the abode of the Lord.

1.3.27

tam mopayatam pratiyantu vipra 
ganga ca devi dhrta-cittam ise |
dvijopasrstah kuhakas taksako va 
dasatv alam gayata visnu-gathah || 28

In the First Canto, tolerance of the bhava-bhakti is illustrated as follows:
O brahmanas, just accept me as a completely surrendered soul, and let mother Ganga, the representative of the Lord, also accept me in that way, for I have already taken the lotus feet of the Lord into my heart. Let the snake-bird - or whatever magical thing the brahmana created - bite me at once. I only desire that you all continue singing the deeds of Lord Visnu. SB 1.19.15

1.3.29
atha avyartha-kalatvamб yatha hari-bhakti-sudhodaye -
vagbhih stuvanto manasa smarantas
tanva namanto 'py anisam na trptah |

ayur harer eva samarpayanti || 29

Not wasting time is illustrated in Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya:
The devotees continually praise the Lord with words, remember Him with their minds, and offer respects with their bodies. Still they are not satisfied. With tears flowing from their eyes, they offer their complete lives to the Lord.

Detachment is illustrated in the Fifth Canto:
While in the prime of life, the great Maharaja Bharata gave up everything because he was found of serving the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Uttamasloka. He gave up his beautiful wife, nice children, great friends and an enormous empire. Although these things were very difficult to give up, Maharaja Bharata was so exalted that he gave them up just as one gives up stool after evacuating. Such was the greatness of His Majesty. SB 5.14.43

atha mana-sunyata -
utkrstatve 'py amanitvam kathita mana-sunyata || 32

bhiksam atann ari-pure svapakam api vandate || 33

Pridelessness is illustrated in the Padma Purana:
King Bharata, though the crest jewel among kings, went out begging at the house of his enemies, and offered respects to the dog-eaters, because he had rati for the Lord.

hinarthadhika-sadhake tvayi tathapy acchedya-mula sati 
he gopi-jana-vallabha vyathayate ha ha mad-asaiva mam || 35

An example of confidence is the following statement of Sanatana Gosvami:
I do not have prema or the practices of hearing or chanting in bhakti. I have no practice of meditation of Visnu in the astanga-yoga process, nor do I have practices of jnana or varnasrama duties. I do not even have good birth to execute these actions properly. But since you are most merciful to the least qualified, O dear lover of the gopis, though I have impure desires, my aspiration for You continue to agitate me.

1.3.36
atha samutkantha  -

O Govinda! Today, the young girl with a sweet voice, whose lotus eyes are streaming with tears of honey, is singing Your names.

1.3.39

manmathata tasya kim api kaisoram |

Attachment to discussing about the Lord’s qualities is described in the Krisna-karnamrta (88):
That youthful Krisna, with the qualities of Cupid, who is extremely sweet and extremely fickle, has stolen my heart. What should I do? 

1.3.40
